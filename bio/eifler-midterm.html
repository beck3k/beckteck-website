<h1><strong>Claim 1:</strong> By using codons.tRNA is able to accurately produce the proper amino acid.</h1>
<h1><strong>Claim 2:</strong> The nitrogen bases(Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine) combination of 3 allows for enough data to store that mutation will have little effect and allow for redundant results</h1>

<p><strong>Article 1</strong></p>
<p>In this article they determine how factors, including mutations and radiation, affect the efficiency and result of the translation. The data proves that the efficiency of the translation was kept in codon:anti-codon even in harsh condition. This supports claim that codons are accurately able to produce the proper amino acid because the proper amino acid was consistently produced. This supports that small changes in duplicate(mutation) may not dramatically change the future generation and replacement cells can be produced relatively accurately.</p>
<p><strong>Article 2</strong></p>
<p>This article discusses several types of ribosomal activity (Aminoacyl adenylate synthesis, Self-aminoacylation, RNA 3'-aminoacylation, In vitro select peptidyl transferase ribozymes, Ribosomal peptidyltransferase, Ribonucleotide polymerization) and their efficiency, ability to adapt, and some other factors. This article talks about in terms of evolution and their ability to survive.  It is important that accurate translation occurs and the structure is able to carry out the function.  They took into account the ability to produce the amino acid and interaction between anticodon/codon like in the previous article.  The data supports the importance of producing reliable results and the claims are supported.
