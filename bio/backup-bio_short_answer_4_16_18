<h1><strong>Claim:</strong> You can use various methods to determine accurately the outcome of a genetic cross</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Article 1</strong></h3>
<p>This article discusses using KEGG pathways to determine probability of the genes. They use an enrichment score for KEGG and GO to determine the accuracy. The data shows they can model the possible outcomes accurately and this method supports my claim</p>
<h3><strong>Article 2</strong></h3>
<p>This article shows how the punnet square can be used to determine possible outcomes. The method is old and widely used. The data shows that it can be accurate and supports my claim.</p>
